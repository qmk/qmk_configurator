The QMK Configurator is an online tool used for easily creating firmware files for keyboards supported in [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). The tool is located on https://config.qmk.fm.

The QMK Configurator allows simple keymap creation and saving via .json keymap files, and generates appropriate firmware files for flashing onto selected keyboards.
